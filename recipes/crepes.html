    <p>Here is the step-by-step recipe on how to make those simple-yet-delicious tasty crepes!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p>
